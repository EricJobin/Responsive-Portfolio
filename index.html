      <p>Eric Jobin is a learner at the University of Toronto where he's studying Full Stack Web Development. Undertaking an experimental 12 week intense boot-camp style course, he is preparing for a career in the web development industry and building up a portfolio of work to show off to potential employers.</p>
      <p>Eric Jobin lives in North York, in the Newtonbrook neighbourhood, where he resides in a small condo apartment in a very tall building, surrounded by other very tall buildings. The neighbourhood is known for its easy access to public transportation, and a number of Korean restaurants. Eric can find kimchi on sale at any time of day or night.</p>
      <p>When Eric is not studying or working on web development projects, he can usually be found playing boardgames, drinking tea, or reading.</p>
